= About This Site =

Welcome to the MythTV Info site.

We've put this together as a community site 'cos we're all deeply infatuated with our MythTV boxes.

== So why another site? ==
Well the main thing is that we're here to supplement [http://www.mythtv.org MythTV.org] - in fact, as information gets added, mixed, checked and refined here we hope it will make its way via patches, docs and other winding routes into the OfficialFaq, core MythTV or one of its modules.

It's important to note that if you contribute to this site, you'll be consenting to have your content used in unimaginable ways by anyone who wants to. There's ImportantLicenseInformation you should read before you contribute. The point of all this is so we can use anything on this site to help make MythTV better ;) (Any comments or suggestions to the AdminGroup please - we're winging it and would appreciate feedback!)

== How does it work? ==

Well, it's a Wiki - if that doesn't mean anything to you then take a look at the [wiki:Self/MoinHomePage WikiWiki documentation] to find out more - including how to register (hint look for UserPreferences) and edit these pages yourself - yes that's right - edit them yourselves - I told you to read more about [wiki:Self/MoinHomePage Wikis!]

Think of this site as a scratchpad: ideas get written down, but should be put carefully in the right places else you won't find it back later on, and on the other hand you can scribble down some random thought to see if others know how to write it in a better way. You see, much like a little blocknote you can use for planning some real things.

Before you start editing (and regularly for the next few weeks at least) read the MythTvInfoGuidelines - please!  Those will tell you why, why not, and in what way, and the new (2004-Aug) WikiQuickStart will tell you how, and point you to much more help.

For additional assistance in real-time, try visiting the IRC channel #mythtv-wiki on irc.freenode.net.

If you would like to contribute to the Wiki, and aren't sure what to do, consider writing some of the WantedPages.  An even lighter-weight thing you could do would be to check the FixMe page, and find some question of fact that you're sure of the answer to, and fix it.  There are currently (Sep-04) 15 hits on the FixMe page.
