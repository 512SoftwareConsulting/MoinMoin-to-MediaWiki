= Welcome to MythTV.info! =

We're here to provide a forum (a wiki, actually) for collaborative documentation of the [http://www.mythtv.org MythTV] project, an open source software [[Personal Video Recorder]].  It lets you build a box similar to a TiVo or ReplayTV, but much more powerful - and easily modified.  Because it's a wiki, you can edit (almost) any page yourself if you find a mistake, or have more to add; see the [[Wiki Quick Start]] for more details.

Here's what's on the front page (or linked elsewhere):

* Latest Release
* News
* [[About This Site]]
** What's here?
** How Official Are We?
** How to Contribute
** [[Wiki Quick Start|What is a Wiki?]]

= Site To Move =
It's official.  With the kind permission and help of Isaac, RichK (who's been maintaining the flat-file documentation within the releases), and David Greaves (who was kind enough to set up this wiki in the first place), mythtv.info's content will soon be moving to a slightly-less slashdottable (and more easily accessible, I gather) location, over at MythTV.org World Headquarters.  I've got a bunch of work to do first, including figuring out how to translate Moin pages to [[Media Wiki]] pages, and any help in the [[Site Move]] will be greatly appreciated. [Baylink 15-Feb-05]

= New Release! =
MythTV v0.17 was [http://www.mythtv.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=112 released] at 0545UTC on 11-February-2005.  Some information on the new features and fixed bugs in this release is available on the [[Whats New]] page.

And the Slashdotting we took garnered us some new contributors.  Welcome aboard, folks, and please migrate with us to the new site when we move there.
= News =

'''New Release''' -- 0.17 is out.  The [[Under Development]] page has been moved to [[Whats New]], and copied to [[0.17]] in the [[Release Notes]] section.  Isaac has linked to [[Under Development]] from mythtv.org, so that will remain 0.17 until he changes the link.  [[[Bay Link]] 11-Feb-05]

 (Site note: I'd like to thank [[Brian Le Fevre]] and the other folks who are doing yeoman duty reverting the spammers who have clearly recently found the site.  [[Bay Link]])

'''MythBlog''' -- It has managed to escape me that [[Gavin Hurlbut]] (Beirdo@IRC) has his own [http://mythtv.beirdo.ca/wiki/ FAQ Wiki], covering topics frequently discussed on IRC, as well as writing a [http://mythtv.beirdo.ca/blog/ blog] concerning his experiences working with Myth.  In other news, (I've always wanted to say that :-) Matt Haughey, of Metafilter fame, continues his [http://www.pvrblog.com/ PVRBlog] with coverage of a 10-tuner [[Snap Stream]] box built with the new Hauppauge 500 cards. [[[Bay Link]] 10-Feb-2005]

'''User Manual''' -- I've added a link, above, to my nascent [[User Manual]] project.  While it is even more a work in progress than some other things associated with the wiki, and indeed, Myth itself, I think it's just barely fleshed out to the point that it's time to link to it from somewhere more prominent than my User page.  All contributions, as always, welcome.  [[[Bay Link]] 09-Feb-2005]

'''German Wiki''' -- I've felt free to create a german Wiki, since some users expressed the wish to have a German community. Please not that this Wiki doesn't intend to compete with MythTV.info. The site is [http://de-mythwiki.ath.cx/mediawiki/ here] . In addition, there is a now a German subforum at [http://www.mythtvtalk.com mythtvtalk.com]. [[[Michael Haas]]]

'''New York Times MythTV''' -- [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/arts/television/30manl.html?ex=1264741200&en=e82b9db497df2928&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland The New York Times] has an article on Isaac and MythTV. [[[John Sturgeon]] 31-Jan-05]
Some MythTV users think that this article is bad publicity for MythTV. If you agree, you probably want to sign [http://www.sphereux.com/mythtv-nyt/ this petition] [[[Michael Haas]] 01-Feb-05]

[ That is much too polite: the article damned near explicitly lumps MythTV users in with show-sharers.  Regardless your opinion on show-sharing, the piece is misleading, and I suggest you sign the petition. [[Bay Link]] ]

'''Slashdot on Linux on PVR's''' -- The [http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/12/027210&from=rss /. story] has a bunch of links, so instead of snapping any of them, I'll just link you there.  Finally, some new news.  :-) [[[Bay Link]] 12-Jan-05]

'''Competitive News:''' -- TiVo does it again: now they'll show you [http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,65853,00.html ads while you're skipping ads].  (Thanks to Micah Wedemeyer on the list.)  [[[Bay Link]] 29-Nov-04]

'''CVS Changelog:''' -- The summary of the changes (so far) in CVS is available in [[Under Development]]. This is being updated as new commits are in, but it is not guaranteed to reflect ''all'' new features and bugfixes. [[[Tyler Drake]] 28-Nov-04]

'''Upcoming Hardware:''' -- [http://pchdtv.com pcHDTV] has finally started to offer the HD-3000, a US broadcast HDTV/ATSC capture card that is designed to work with Linux.  Reports also state the card is already compatible with MythTV.  In July of next year a card like this will be illegal to manufacture, as it does *not* support the [[Broadcast Flag]], which allows broadcasters to prevent you from digitally capturing HDTV signals at full resolution.  So get them while you can.  [UPDATE: Some people have received the cards they ordered; no reports of full success yet. [30-Oct-04]

'''Competitive Press:''' -- Even more reasons to [http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/28/1423202 choose MythTV] over TiVo: they're going to feature-reduce even further.  Auto-deletion of pay-per-view recordings whether you like it or not? More from [http://techdirt.com/articles/20041028/0848220.shtml [[Tech Dirt]]] [28-Oct-04]

'''Updates:''' -- Welcome aboard and many thanks to [[nuv2avi]] developer [[Gavin Hurlbut]] for fluffing up our [[External Links]] page, and also to [[Chris Petersen]], who wrote [[Myth Web]] and [[nuvexport]].  [[[Bay Link]] 21-Oct-04]

There is an archive of [[Old News]].
= About MythTV - What is it? =

MythTV is a [[Open Source]] PVR software package that runs under Linux.  (With ports to Windows and MacOS underway.)

What's a PVR? A [[Personal Video Recorder]].

It provides the ability to:
* Watch, pause, fast forward and rewind 'live' TV
* Set recordings from a program guide
* Watch recordings on different TVs (or computers, or projectors) around the house
* Listen to music
* Play all kinds of real arcade games
* Watch DVDs
* Get weather and news from the internet

In other words it lets you build a super-duper home entertainment center.
